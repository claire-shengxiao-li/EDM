            Electronic dance music (also known as EDM) is a broad range of percussive electronic music genres made largely for nightclubs, raves, and festivals.
            By the early 2010s the term "electronic dance music" and the initialism "EDM" was being pushed by the US music industry and music press in an effort to re-brand American rave culture. Despite the industry's attempt to create a specific EDM brand the initialism remains in use as an umbrella term for multiple dance genres, including house, techno, trance, drum and bass, dubstep, and their respective subgenres.

            Contrary to popular belief, dubstep was not directly born from a love of dub music; it started as a darker, more experimental take on the 2-step sound that was running through London in the late 1990s. Clocking in at 140BPM, the early sound of dubstep was far from the aggressive tracks that are associated with the genre today. The music generally features sparse, syncopated drum and percussion patterns with bass lines that contain prominent sub bass frequencies.

            Drum and Bass might be one of the most intense, misunderstood sounds within the EDM scene. While its roots are in the hardcore rave scene of London in the early 1990s, it mutated into a darker, more sinister sound all to its own, gobbling up reggae/dancehall sub-bass with sped-up breakbeats. Clocking in at 160-180 BPMs, the obvious emphasis on the drum work and bassline gives dnb its name. Over the years, it has encompassed a number of sounds, with subgenres incorporating jazz, soul, hip-hop, and even other EDM styles like trance.

            House is one of the most popular forms of EDM. It's almost three decades old, and is one of the truly American-born styles. It grew in Chicago, rising from the aftermath of disco, and the "four-to-the-floor" sound is one of the most recognizable forms of EDM in clubs and on the mainstream. While house displays several characteristics similar to disco music, it is more electronic and minimalistic, and the repetitive rhythm of house is more important than the song itself.

            Trap, in an EDM sense, is the 808-heavy sound that dance music producers have been working within since early 2012. Many credit the production of hip-hop producers like Lex Luger and artists like Rick Ross and Waka Flocka as bringing a new acceptance to what had been for years a sound almost synonymous with southern rap artists like T.I. and Young Jeezy. EDM producers started applying the build-ups, drops, and breakdowns found within many dance music genres to this style of production, and created a monster.

            Techno is a form of electronic dance music that emerged in Detroit, Michigan, in the United States during the mid-to-late 1980s. Techno resulted from the melding of African American music including Chicago house, funk, electro, and electric jazz with electronic music by artists such as Kraftwerk, Giorgio Moroder, and Yellow Magic Orchestra. Many styles of techno now exist, but Detroit techno is seen as the foundation upon which a number of subgenres have been built.

            Trance was born in Germany, and is one of the most popular styles of EDM. Ranging from 110-150BPM, trance is known for repetitiously building up and breaking down huge melodies.  Although trance is a genre of its own, it liberally incorporates influences from other musical styles such as techno, house, pop, chill-out, classical music, tech house, ambient, and film music.
